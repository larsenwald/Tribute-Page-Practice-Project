      <section class="history">
        <h2>A Brief History of Internet Chonkers</h2>
        <p>
          The internet's fascination with fat cats dates back to the early
          2010s, when social media platforms began sharing photos of
          particularly round felines. The trend exploded with the creation of
          the "Oh Lawd He Comin'" chart - a humorous classification system for
          cat sizes ranging from "A Fine Boi" to "Mega Chonker."
        </p>
        <p>
          Notable celebrities in the chonky cat world include Cinderblock, the
          workout-resistant cat whose treadmill videos went viral, and Pusheen,
          the cartoon cat whose love for food and lounging resonated with
          millions.

        <h2>What Makes a Chonky Cat Special?</h2>
        <div class="characteristics-grid">
          <div class="characteristic">
            <h3>The Waddle</h3>
            <p>
              There's something undeniably endearing about the distinctive way a
              chonky cat moves. That signature waddle, accompanied by the gentle
              swaying of their substantial belly, has become legendary among cat
              enthusiasts.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="characteristic">
            <h3>The Loaf Form</h3>
            <p>
              When a chonky cat sits in the famous "loaf" position, with paws
              tucked underneath, they achieve a nearly perfect rectangular form
              that puts regular-sized cat loaves to shame.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="characteristic">
            <h3>The Lap Presence</h3>
            <p>
              Any lap graced by a chonky cat knows the unique combination of
              honor and mild discomfort that comes with being chosen as their
              resting place. Their substantial weight serves as a natural
              weighted blanket.

        <h2>A Note on Health and Wellness</h2>

        <p>
          While we celebrate these lovable large cats, it's crucial to address
          the serious side of feline obesity. Excess weight can lead to various
          health issues in cats, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diabetes</li>
          <li>Joint problems</li>
          <li>Heart disease</li>
          <li>Reduced lifespan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have a chonky cat at home, consider working with your
          veterinarian to develop a safe weight loss plan. Remember, gradual
          weight loss is key to maintaining your cat's health and happiness.

            <h3>Diet Management</h3>
            <p>
              Portion control and high-quality food are essential. Consider wet
              food options and measured meals instead of free feeding.

            <p>
              Encourage play with interactive toys, laser pointers, and climbing
              structures. Even a few minutes of activity several times a day can
              make a difference.
